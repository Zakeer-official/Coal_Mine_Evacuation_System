# Project Title:  Coal Mine Evacuation System Using Multi-Sensor Control

# Description: 
The "Coal Mine Evacuation System" is a sophisticated and intelligent solution designed to enhance the safety and efficiency of evacuations in coal mines. This innovative system integrates multiple sensors and control mechanisms to detect and respond to emergency situations, ensuring the well-being of miners during critical moments. By employing a combination of gas sensors, temperature and humidity sensors, obstacle detection sensors, emergency lighting controls, and communication interfaces, the project offers a comprehensive approach to mitigating potential risks in coal mines.

# Key Features:

Gas Detection: Utilizes gas sensors to detect hazardous gases that could pose a threat to miners' health and safety.
Temperature and Humidity Monitoring: Keeps track of environmental conditions within the mine to prevent dangerous temperature and humidity levels.
Obstacle Detection: Uses obstacle detection sensors to guide miners safely through the evacuation path, avoiding obstacles and potential hazards.
Emergency Lighting Control: Ensures adequate lighting during evacuations by controlling emergency lighting systems based on ambient light levels.
Communication Interface: Provides a two-way communication interface between miners and rescue teams, enabling real-time status updates and coordination.
Alerts and Notifications: Activates visual and auditory alerts in response to gas detection, obstacles, and other emergency scenarios.
Evacuation Routing: Guides miners through the safest and shortest evacuation routes using obstacle detection and mine layout mapping.
Centralized Monitoring: Offers real-time monitoring of multiple parameters, enabling quick decision-making and resource allocation during emergencies.

The "Coal Mine Evacuation System" serves as a crucial tool for enhancing the safety protocols within coal mines, ensuring miners are well-prepared and informed during emergency situations. By harnessing the power of multi-sensor control systems, this project showcases the potential of technology in safeguarding lives and improving the overall safety standards in challenging work environments.
